create malwares with less that 20 lines of code.
At the begining, PyMalware will be a realy small module.
But it works with comunity princip : If you know how to do a payload, feels free
to send it to [pythonhackingtools@gmail.com](mailto:pythonhackingtools@gmail.com).
If your code is great, I'll add it to PyMalware.
